= Remote Schema Locations

XJC supports processing schemas from remote locations, in addition to schemas stored in the
local file system.

To use such remote schemas with the `{plugin-id}` Gradle plugin, add a text file
with the extension `.url` into your `src/main/schema` directory. The `.url` file should list
one remote schema URL per line.

For example, to use the link:https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/[xmldsig] schema from w3.org,
add the following file to your project:

[source,text]
.src/main/schema/xmldsig.url
----
https://www.w3.org/TR/2002/REC-xmldsig-core-20020212/xmldsig-core-schema.xsd
----

Note that this works best with schemas that are guaranteed to be immutable at the remote
location. If your `.url` file or other input files do not change, the Gradle task will not
pick up changes from the remote schema location, and will still report as "up to date" in the
Gradle build.

TIP: To force a re-run of XJC even if your input files have not changed, use the `--rerun-tasks`
flag when invoking Gradle.

In most cases, it is still recommended to manually download the `.xsd` files and put them into
your source directory. This will make your build less dependent on outside circumstances or network
connectivity, and thus more robust and reproducible.
