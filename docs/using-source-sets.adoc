= Using Source Sets

Many Gradle Java projects use multiple
link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/building_java_projects.html#sec:java_source_sets[source sets]. This
includes the `main` source set for the project's production code, as well as the `test` source set for unit tests by
default, and can easily be extended with additional, custom source sets in a Gradle build script.


== Support for Multiple Source Sets

The `{plugin-id}` plugin adds XJC functionality for _each_ source set in the project, both for existing
source sets and source sets that are added after the plugin is applied.

For each source set there will be a task of type `XjcGenerate` that will do the actual work of invoking XJC for
the source set. You will rarely need to call this task directly, because the plugin already sets up task dependencies
for `compileJava` so that the generated sources are ready before the compilation starts.


== Customizing Paths

By default, all XJC input files for a source set are expected in the `src/<name>/schema` directory, where `<name>`
is the name of the source set. For example,

- put XJC input files for the `main` source set into `src/main/schema`;
- put XJC input files for the `test` source set into `src/test/schema`.

If you would like to change the default subdirectory name from `schema` to something else, you can do this conveniently
by setting the `xjcSrcDir` property on the project's global `xjc` extension. For example, to use the `xjc` subdirectory
instead of `schema`:

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
xjc {
    srcDirName = 'xjc'
}
----

[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
xjc {
    srcDirName.set("xjc")
}
----

Each group of input files (schemas, binding customizations, catalogs, and URL sources) is also made available
on the source set as a
link:https://docs.gradle.org/current/dsl/org.gradle.api.file.SourceDirectorySet.html#org.gradle.api.file.SourceDirectorySet[`SourceDirectorySet`]
for further customization:

- `xjcSchema` for schema files
- `xjcBinding` for binding customization files
- `xjcUrl` for files listing remote schema URLs
- `xjcCatalog` for catalog files

For example, to include another directory containing catalogs:

[source,groovy,role="primary"]
.Groovy
----
sourceSets {
    main {
        xjcCatalog.srcDir("custom/catalog/path")
    }
}
----

[source,kotlin,role="secondary"]
.Kotlin
----
sourceSets.named("main") {
    xjcCatalog.srcDir("custom/catalog/path")
}
----
